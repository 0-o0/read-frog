## Your Personal Reading Companion Gets a Voice üîä

Reading long articles? Learning a new language? Sometimes, **hearing** the text makes all the difference.

We're excited to introduce **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** to Read Frog‚Äîa feature that transforms any text on the web into natural-sounding audio with a single click.

<Callout type="info">
**Current Version**: TTS is currently available with OpenAI providers only. Support for additional AI providers is coming soon.
</Callout>

**Special Thanks**: This feature was contributed by community member [@darmau](https://github.com/darmau). Thank you for bringing this powerful feature to Read Frog!

## Why Text-to-Speech?

Reading isn't always convenient. Maybe you're:
- üö∂ Walking or commuting
- üëÄ Giving your eyes a rest after hours of screen time
- üåç Learning pronunciation in a foreign language
- üìö Absorbing long-form content more effectively

With TTS, you can **listen** while you multitask, learn, or simply relax.

<Callout type="info">
**Did you know?** Listening to content can improve comprehension and retention, especially for auditory learners.
</Callout>

## How It Works

Getting started with TTS is incredibly simple:

### 1. Configure Your Voice Settings

Navigate to **Options ‚Üí Text-to-Speech** to customize your listening experience.

{/* TODO: Add screenshot - TTS settings page showing voice, model, and speed options */}

Choose from:
- **Voice**: Pick from 11 natural-sounding voices (Alloy, Ash, Ballad, Coral, Echo, and more)
- **Model**: Select between `gpt-4o-mini-tts`, `tts-1`, or `tts-1-hd` for higher quality
- **Speed**: Adjust playback speed from 0.25√ó to 4√ó to match your preference

<Callout type="tip">
**Pro tip**: Try the Preview button to hear each voice before making your choice. Find the perfect voice that suits your listening style!
</Callout>

### 2. Select and Listen

Once configured, simply:

1. **Select any text** on any webpage
2. **Click the speaker icon** in the toolbar
3. **Sit back and listen** as the text is read aloud

{/* TODO: Add screenshot - Text selection with TTS speaker button highlighted */}

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Manual reading only | Listen while browsing |
| Copy-paste to external TTS tools | One-click instant playback |
| No voice customization | 11+ voices to choose from |

## Smart Performance Features

We've built TTS with efficiency in mind:

### Audio Caching
Once audio is generated, it's **cached locally**‚Äîreplay the same text instantly without regenerating.

<Callout type="info">
The cache stores up to **10 audio files** using an intelligent LRU (Least Recently Used) strategy, so your most-played content is always ready.
</Callout>

### Long Text Support
Selected a massive paragraph? **No problem.** The extension automatically chunks long text and streams audio seamlessly for uninterrupted listening.

### Single Playback Control
Only one audio plays at a time. Click the speaker icon again to stop or switch to a new selection without overlapping audio chaos.
